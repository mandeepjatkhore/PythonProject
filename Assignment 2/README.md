# Python Project: Number Analysis and Summation

This project is a simple Python program designed to demonstrate basic control structures such as conditional statements and loops.

The program performs two main operations:

Task 1. **Even or Odd Check**  
   The user is prompted to enter an integer. The program checks whether the number is even or odd using basic arithmetic logic and prints the result. This helps in understanding how conditional logic and user input work in Python.

Task 2. **Summation from 1 to 50**  
   After checking the number, the program calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a loop. This demonstrates the use of iterative constructs like the `for` loop and basic variable operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- No third-party libraries required

## How to Run

1. Save the program in a file (e.g., `Task1/2.py`)
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the file using the command:
