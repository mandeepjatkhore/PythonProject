# Python Mini-Project: Recursion and Math Module

This project contains two Python tasks aimed at practicing recursion and usage of the `math` module for basic mathematical operations.

---

## 📌 Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using Recursion

### 🔸 Objective:
Create a Python function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using **recursion**.

### 🔹 Instructions:
- Define a function that takes one argument (the number).
- Implement recursion inside the function to calculate factorial.
- Include a base case to avoid infinite recursion.
- Prompt the user or define a number to compute the factorial.
- Print the result.

## 📌 Task 2: Perform Calculations Using the Math Module

### 🔸 Objective:
Use Python’s built-in `math` module to perform common mathematical operations.

### 🔹 Instructions:
- Import the `math` module at the beginning of the script.
- Perform the following operations:
  - Calculate the **square root** of a number.
  - Compute the **natural logarithm (log base e)** of a number.
  - Find the **sine of an angle** (convert degrees to radians if needed).
- Display the results using `print()` statements.

## ✅ Requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- No external libraries required.

## ▶️ How to Run the Program:
1. Save your code in a `.py` file (e.g., `main.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the file.
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
